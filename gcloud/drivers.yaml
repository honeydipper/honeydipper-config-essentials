              Honeydipper interact with k8s clusters through :code:`kubernetes` driver. However, the :code:`kubernetes` driver
              needs to obtain kubeconfig information such as credentials, certs, API endpoints etc. This is achieved through
              making a RPC call to k8s type drivers. This driver is one of the k8s type driver.

            - >
              In order to be able to store sensitive configurations encrypted at rest, Honeydipper needs to be able to decrypt
              the content. :code:`DipperCL` uses e-yaml style notion to store the encrypted content, the type of the encryption
              and the payload/parameter is enclosed by the square bracket :code:`[]`. For example.

            - example: |
                mydata: ENC[gcloud-kms,...base64 encoded ciphertext...]

              This driver enables Honeydipper to fetch items stored in Google Secret Manager.

            - >
              With access to Google Secret Manager, Honeydipper doesn't have to rely on cipher texts stored directly into the
              configurations in the repo. Instead, it can query the Google Secret Manager, and get access to the secrets based
              on the permissions granted to the identity it uses. :code:`DipperCL` uses a keyword interpolation to detect the items
              that need to be looked up using :code:`LOOKUP[<driver>,<key>]`. See blow for example.

            - example: |
                mydata: LOOKUP[gcloud-secret,projects/foo/secrets/bar/versions/latest]

            - >
              As of now, the driver doesn't take any configuration other than the generic `api_timeout`. It uses the default service
              account as its identity.

          RPCs:
            - name: lookup
              description: Lookup a secret in Google Secret Manager
