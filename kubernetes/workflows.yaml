          This workflow creates a k8s job with given job spec. It is not recommended to use this workflow directly.
          Instead, use :code:`run_kubernetes` to leverage all the predefined context variables.

          This workflow is a helper to add a step into :code:`steps` context variable to ensure the in-cluster
          kubeconfig is used. Basically, it will delete the kubeconfig files if any presents. It is useful when
          switching from other clusters to local cluster in the same k8s job.

        - name: steps
          description: >
            The steps that the job is made up with. Each step is an :code:`initContainer` or
            a :code:`container`. The steps are executed one by one as ordered in the list.
            A failure in a step will cause the whole job to fail. Each step is defined with fields
            including :code:`type`, :code:`command`, or :code:`shell`. The :code:`type` tells k8s what image to use,
            the :code:`command` is the command to be executed with language supported by that image. If
            a shell script needs to be executed, use :code:`shell` instead of :code:`command`.

            Also supported are :code:`env` and :code:`volumes` for defining the environment variables and
            volumes specific to this step.

            A list of environment variables for all the steps.
        - name: volumes
          description: >
            A list of volumes to be attached for all the steps. By default, there will be a :code:`EmptyDir` volume
            attached at :code:`/honeydipper`. Each item should have a `name` and `volume` and optionally a `subPath`, and
            they will be used for creating the volume definition and volume mount definition.
        - name: workingDir
          description: >
            The working directory in which the command or script to be exected. By default, :code:`/honeydipper`.
            Note that, the default :code:`workingDir` defined in the image is not used here.

        - name: script_types
          description: >
            A map of predefined script types. The :code:`type` field in :code:`steps` will be used to select
            the image here. :code:`image` field is required. :code:`command_entry` is used for defining the entrypoint
            when using :code:`command` field in step, and :code:`command_prefix` are a list or a string that inserted at the top of
            container args. Correspondingly, the :code:`shell_entry` and :code:`shell_prefix` are used for defining the entrypoint
            and argument prefix for running a `shell` script.

            Also supported is an optional :code:`securtyContext` field for defining the image security context.

        - name: predefined_steps
          description: >
            A map of predefined steps. Use the name of the predefined step in :code:`steps` list to easily define a step without
            specifying the fields. This makes it easier to repeat or share the steps that can be used in multiple places. We can also
            override part of the predefined steps when defining the steps with `use` and overriding fields.

            By default, the job will not retry if the pod fails (:code:`backoffLimit` set to 0), you can use this
