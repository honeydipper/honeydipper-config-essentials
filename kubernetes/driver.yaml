#
#   interacting with kubernetes objects using kubernetes API
#
#   Prereq:
#     * include the basic bundle from this repo
#
#   Integration:
#     Config the driver in the `drivers` section with following parameters.
#
#     * loglevel: the verbosity of logs generated by this driver, DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR

# RawAction: recycleDeployment
#
#   Recycle a deployment by delete its replicaset. Thanks to the deployment manager, the new replicaset
#   will be created before the old one is destroyed.
#
#   Parameters:
#
#     * deployment: a label selector for the deployment (required)
#     * namespace: the namespace where the deployment is in, defaults to "default"
#     * source: the cluster information
#       * type: which driver provides the cluster information, (gcloud-gke, local, etc.)
#       * ... needed for the making a RPC call to the driver to fetch cluster endpoint and auth info.
#
#   Return:
#
#     Use ".label.status" in `interpolation` to check status, "success" or "failure".

#       * type: which driver provides the cluster information, (gcloud-gke, local, etc.)
#       * ... needed for the making a RPC call to the driver to fetch cluster endpoint and auth info.
#
#   Return:
#
#     Use ".label.status" in `interpolation` to check status, "success" or "failure".
#
#     * .label.status:  "success" or "failure"
