          This driver shares the code with `redispubsub` driver. The purpose is provide a abstract
          feature for services to make broadcasts to each other. The current `redispubsub` driver
          offers a few functions through a `call_driver`. Once the `DipperCL` offers `call_feature`
          statement, we can consolidate the loading of the two drivers into one.
